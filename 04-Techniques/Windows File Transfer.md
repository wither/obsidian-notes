# Windows File Transfer

## Overview

For transferring files to/from Windows machines.

## Key Concepts

To avoid detection, it's recommended to try to use Windows-native tools to transfer files as much as possible.

## Common Methods

### Powershell

#### Method 1: Base64 Encoding

> [!warning] While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings. 

**Step 1:** Check the MD5 hash of the contents.
```bash
md5sum id_rsa
```

**Step 2:** Encode contents to base64 and copy it to clipboard.
```bash
cat id_rsa | base64 -w 0; echo
```

**Step 3:** On the Windows machine, decode the contents in your clipboard to a file.
![[Powershell#^decode-base64-to-file]]

**Step 4:** Confirm the MD5 hash matches
![[Powershell#^get-file-md5-hash]]

>[!info] This can also be done in reverse to recieve the file on the attacker machine.

**Step 1:** Check the MD5 hash of the contents.
![[Powershell#^decode-base64-to-file]]

**Step 2:** Encode contents to base64 and copy it to clipboard.
![[Powershell#^encode-file-contents-to-base64]]

**Step 3:** On the Linux machine, decode the contents in your clipboard to a file.
```bash
echo "base64 content" | base64 -d > hosts
```

**Step 4:** Confirm the MD5 hash matches.
```bash
md5sum id_rsa
```

#### Method 2:  DownloadFile

Download a file to a specified location.
![[Powershell#^downloadfile-method]]

---
#### Method 2:  DownloadString - Fileless

Download and execute a remote file in memory - filelessly!
![[Powershell#^downloadstring-method-fileless]]

---
#### Method 3: Invoke-WebRequest

> [!warning]  `Invoke-WebRequest` is noticeably slower at downloading files than `(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile`

Download a file to a specified location.
![[Powershell#^outfile-invoke-webrequest]]

### SMB

#### Method 1: impacket-smbserver

**Step 1:** Create an SMB server
![[impacket-smbserver#^create-authenticated-smb-server]]

**Step 2:** Mount the SMB server
```powershell
net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test
```

**Step 3:** Copy the file from the share
```powershell
copy n:\<file>
```

### FTP

#### Method 1: pyftpdlib

**Step 1:** Create an FTP server with Python
![[Python#^create-ftp-server]]

**Step 2:** Download the files
![[Powershell#^downloadfile-method]]
