### Base64 Encoding

**Step 1:** Check the MD5 hash of the contents.
```bash
md5sum id_rsa
```

**Step 2:** Encode contents to base64 and copy it to clipboard.
```bash
cat id_rsa | base64 -w 0; echo
```

**Step 3:** On the second Linux machine, decode the Base64 file content.
```bash
echo -n 'encoded' | base64 -d > id_rsa
```

**Step 4:** Confirm the MD5 hash matches.
```bash
md5sum id_rsa
```
